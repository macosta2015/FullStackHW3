        <div class="sample-img">My name is Mario Acosta and I graduated in 2019 as a Mechancial Engineer with a minor in Computer Science. 
            I created WeWe.io which is a web application that helped college students know what events and activities were happening around campus. We were able to pitch and meet Steve Case, the AOL founder. 
            <p>
            </p>
            Currenly I work and live in Miami, working in Titan America as a mining and process engineer. We are a vertical integrated company selling Aggregates, Cement, Ready-Mix, and Block. 
            <p>
